        <h1>THE RESEARCH:</h1>
      <p class="card-text">The objective of our research was to understand what actions customers take when they consider their recipe choices, buying groceries for intended recipes and how much left-over ingredients they have after a meal. 

        The methodology used for this study was, one-on-one generative research interviews to better understand our users and empathize with their needs. We interviewed five participants ranging from ages 24-39, who had general interests in cooking, and were the main individual purchasing groceries for their household. Participants also had a focus on “healthy” eating and discourage food waste. Interviews were recorded with Otter.ai and transcripts were referred back to when creating our user-persona. </p>

  <!-- the problem statement section using smt component-->
  <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="display-4">THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:</h1>
      <p class="lead">We have observed that young working professionals are avoiding cooking at home by relying on food delivery services and wasting groceries due to lack of inspiration or desire to cook. How might we help our users repurpose the ingredients they already have while providing them with easy to cook recipes that don’t require a lot of time or skills?</p>

  <!-- the iteration section using media list component-->
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li class="media">
      <img src="images/iteration 1.png" class="mr-3" alt="first iteration photo">
      <div class="media-body">
        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">ITERATION 1</h5>
        We noticed from the user testing is that users did not know that scrolling was an option. Our hi-fi prototype reflects that there is more on the page and that scrolling is an option.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="media my-4">
      <img src="images/iteration 2.png" class="mr-3" alt="second iteration photo">
      <div class="media-body">
        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">ITERATION 2</h5>
        Feedback from our user testing approved of the option to use the app as a guest. This would save time for first time users to get introduced to Garden Plate without the commitment of signing up.
      </div>

    <li class="media">

      <div class="media-body">
        <h5 class="mt-0 mb-1">ITERATION 3</h5>
        A notable iteration we made was to indicate that there was a drop down option to watch the recipe videos.

     This is our final product after the user testings. While there is evidence of large amounts of food waste every year, since the pandemic, there hasn’t been insight to what those numbers look like now. The user interviews suggested that rather than food waste, there wasn’t even enough time to buy foods to not use. We followed the user's needs: wanting to cook from home, having little time to cook, and wanting to keep healthy food practices in mind is where Garden Plate sprouted from.
